    "> If $S$ is a discrete set, show that if the set of distributions on $S$, $\\mathbb{P}(S)$, is compact in $S$, then $S$ is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**: Argue contrapositively: that is, show $|S| = |\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_{0} \\implies \\mathbb{P}(S)$ not compact. (Sequential) compactness requires that every sequence in a subset $K$ contains a subsequence which converges to a point in $S$. Let $K$ be the set of delta distributions $(1, 0, 0, ...), (0, 1, 0, ...)$, and so on. These form a subset of $S$, but clearly no subsequence converges, as the $l_1$  norm of their difference of any two of them is always 2. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(S)$ compact shows $S$ finite for discrete $S$.\n"

    "> Show that the deterministic Markov chain given by $X_{t+1} = X_t + 1$ has no stationary distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** We can uniquely identify each state $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with a probability distribution $p_{\\gamma} \\in \\mathbb{P}(S)$. This is because $p_{\\gamma}$ is the dirac distibrution which assigns mass 1 to $\\gamma + 1$ and weight 0 everywhere else, and $\\gamma + 1$ is uniquely identified with $\\gamma$. So, a stationary distribution which maps to itself would correspond to a state $\\gamma$ which maps to itself, which would require $\\gamma + 1 = \\gamma$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no stationary distribution exists."

    "> Consider a Markov process given by the following dynamics. Select an integer $Q$, and an integer $0 \\leq q \\leq Q$. At time $t$, a store's inventory $X_t$ is some integer. The store then orders inventory $Q - X_t$ subject to a threshold rule: if $X_t \\leq q$ the store orders $Q - X_t$, and if not the store orders nothing. The store is then subject to a stochastic demand, IID with $\\text{Pr}[D = d]$ given by $\\frac{1}{2}^{d+1}$ for $d \\in \\{0, 1, ...\\}$. The store meets the demand as best it can without exceeding its current stock. The remainder, zero or nonzero, forms the next period's inventory $X_{t+1}$. \n",

The associated Markov chain is irreducible, as given any initial state $\\gamma$, there is positive probability on the event of selling all one's inventory, then selling some $Q-\\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\\epsilon \\in \\{0, 1, ..., Q\\}$.\n",
